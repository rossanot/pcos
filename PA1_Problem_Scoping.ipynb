Some of those are accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity. In the health care sector sensitivity and specificity are broadly used. For this project, sensitivity will tell how good the model is for classifying women with PCOS. On the other hand, specificity will inform how good the model is for classifying women that do not have PCOS. These metrics provide a score from 0 to 1 or from 0 to 100, being 1 (100) the best level of classification. It is important to note that these scores give information about the performance of the model for a specific threshold that will classify women with and without PCOS. If the data of this study is imbalanced, the area under the curve (AUC) score could help for this potential issue. AUC score will summarize the metrics at all PCOS classification thresholds. The ideal scenario will be a performance with metrics with more than 90%. For instance, a model that applied the random forest algorithm for PCOS prediction showed 93.25 % of accuracy (Tiwari, et al., 2022).\n","\n","\n","## 2. **Time**\n","\n","Estimated time for real-life machine learning projects.

A type of cost function approach known as the cross entropy function will be used to evaluate the difference between the predicted result and the actual value.

Data of this machine learning project comes from different hospitals in the state of Kerala, in India (Kaggle, n.d). Thus, in this case, data was under the regulation of the Indian Medical Council Act (Basu, et al., 2020), which defines “Defining privacy between patient and doctor” (Basu, et al., 2020). Another ethical guideline for this data was the Digital Information Security in Healthcare Act (Basu, et al., 2020), which “ensures electronic health data privacy, confidentiality, security and standardization” (Basu, et al., 2020). In order to keep the confidentiality of the participants of this data, the kaggle author did not include personal information such as name, address, health care identification or in which hospital the clinical information was taken. Therefore, it is safe to say that there is not an ethical issue for privacy in this case.\n","\n","- **Fairness**\n","This refers to the potential bias in the acquisition of the data (Basu, et al., 2020). For this machine learning project it is not clear if the quantification of the different medical tests were carried out with the same technology. Also, it is unknown if there is a diverse set of participants that include women from different areas in Kerala or from different socioeconomic backgrounds. In summary, there is uncertainty for the test measurements and the demographic information of the participants.\n","\n","- **Accountability**\n","In ethics, accountability is the circumstance where a person, a group of people or an organization takes responsibility for particular outcomes by accepting moral and legal actions (Basu, et al., 2020). Artificial intelligence and machine learning creates a gap for accountability. For instance, at some point, the developer of a machine learning technology could not be able to predict “the future machine behavior anymore and thus cannot be held morally responsible or liable for it” (Basu, et al., 2020). It seems that for a classification PCOS model there is not a future unpredictable behavior beyond of determining which patient has or do not have a PCOS\n","\n","- **Transparency**\n","Users and developers of the PCOS machine learning classification model have the ethical responsibility of  reporting the most suitable metrics (Basu, et al., 2020). For example, in the case of imbalance data, accuracy will not be the best way to report the performance of the model because this metric could mislead the diagnosis of PCOS.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"8sSkma5OuBtO"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **References**\n","\n","- Balıkçı Çiçek, İ. , Küçükakçalı, Z. & Yağın, F.
